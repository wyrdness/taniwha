## Overview

Taniwha are supernatural beings in Māori mythology that dwell in deep water—oceans, rivers, lakes, and caves. These powerful creatures serve as both **guardians and dangers**, protecting tribal territories and sacred sites while also posing threats to those who disrespect them or their domains.

Taniwha can take many forms, most commonly appearing as massive reptilian or dragon-like creatures, though they may also manifest as whales, sharks, or even logs. **Each iwi (tribe) and hapū (sub-tribe) has its own taniwha**, often connected to specific waterways and acting as kaitiaki (guardians) of those areas.

**CULTURAL SENSITIVITY**: Taniwha are part of **living Māori spiritual and cultural tradition**. They represent deep connections to land (whenua), water, and tribal identity. Modern New Zealand continues to negotiate taniwha beliefs in contexts from road planning to environmental protection.
