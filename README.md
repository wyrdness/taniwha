## Overview

Taniwha are supernatural beings in Māori mythology that dwell in deep water—oceans, rivers, lakes, and caves. These powerful creatures serve as both **guardians and dangers**, protecting tribal territories and sacred sites while also posing threats to those who disrespect them or their domains.

Taniwha can take many forms, most commonly appearing as massive reptilian or dragon-like creatures, though they may also manifest as whales, sharks, or even logs. **Each iwi (tribe) and hapū (sub-tribe) has its own taniwha**, often connected to specific waterways and acting as kaitiaki (guardians) of those areas.

In Māori worldview, taniwha represent the spiritual dimension of water bodies and embody the relationship between people and their environment. They enforce traditional restrictions (tapu/rahui), protect resources, and punish those who break sacred laws. Many taniwha are considered ancestors (tīpuna) of particular iwi, establishing deep genealogical and spiritual connections.

**CULTURAL SENSITIVITY**: Taniwha are part of **living Māori spiritual and cultural tradition**, not mere mythology. They remain active in New Zealand consciousness, influencing environmental management, infrastructure planning, and cultural identity. Modern New Zealand continues to negotiate taniwha beliefs in contexts from road planning to environmental protection, reflecting ongoing indigenous rights and cultural respect discussions.
